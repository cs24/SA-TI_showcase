       <a href="http://stoq.punchcyber.com/">stoQ</a> falls under a “file analysis framework” tool kit. It allows analysts to leverage all of the tools at their disposal and aggregate them into a single pain of glass.  Ryan Kovar and Marcus LaFerrera gave a talk at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/RyanKovar/stoqing-your-splunk">SANS DFIR2016 </a> .  Organizations can use tools like stoQ to dig deeper into their own files and emails without utilizing external sources like Virustotal or malwr.org while using your own plugins for the automation of analysis that matters to you! Download the code (or docker image) from  <a href="https://github.com/PUNCH-Cyber/stoq">stoQ's github</a> and take it for a spin!

        For the stoQ app we designed wrote a data ingestion TA and an App to bring that stoQ data into Splunk and also use it
      <a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3196/">TA</a> and <a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3195/">SA</a>.
