<h2>Welcome to the companion app for "The Threat Intel Victory Garden: Creating, Capturing, and Using Your Own
Threat Intelligence Using Open Source Tools" presented on Jan 31, 2017 at the SANS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Summit</h2>
              <p/>  
<b>Abstract:</b>
              <p/>Many threat intel programs ignore the most valuable source of intelligence: their own
environment. In the battle to secure your organization, the benefits of “growing your own”
threat intelligence are many. Self-sourced threat intel is quite possibly the most relevant origin
of indicators when detecting and investigating actionable threats faced by your organization.
Home-grown threat intel is also easy to prioritize and enrich because much of the original
context is available. Unfortunately, many threat intelligence programs are hampered by manual
processes and procedures. In this talk we will briefly discuss some common internal sources of
threat intelligence, then present some novel collection techniques including open source tools
like the stoQ framework and open source honeypot solutions. We will show through recorded
demonstrations how indicators from these sources can be sourced, centrally stored, managed,
and leveraged in an automated method. Pointers to usable code/resources that attendees can
take advantage of immediately will be provided.<p/>
