        LinkedIn contains a wealth of information about your organization. Attackers use it to perform reconnaissance, but WE can use it as a source of intelligence as well.<p/>

Getting started. Itâ€™s simply useful to know who has associated themselves with your org on LinkedIn. Why? Among other things it makes it very easy to convince legit employees to accept invitations, and then they can see a LOT more detail.<p/>

Take for example this brand new user who only connected with Ryan and me. Immediately this user has visibility into hundreds of Splunk users.<p/>

        The code used in this example is able to pull LinkedIn contact data for an organization without access to the API. This module was created by Richard Warren and submitted to the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng">recon-ng project</a> as a pull request. The code can be viewed here:
